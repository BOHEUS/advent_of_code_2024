# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code tasks, all solutions are uploaded after leaderboard for day is filled.
Inputs are omitted in code as every person has different input.

As it's perfect time to train programming skills and discover new things, I chose to go with Zed editor when writing code.
As for programming language, primarily it'll be Python but that's subject to change.

Also, it's only about correctness, speed and memory aren't primary focus when writing code.
